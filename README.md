# Electricity-data-app

This interactive dashboard utilises the extensive electricity dataset for the European continent which is created and managed by Ember. The purpose of this dashboard is to make use of libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, and Plotly Express to create visualitations and perform calculations following a user's country selection in the app. 

By using this app, a user can explore the changes of the energy mix over time for different countries as well as develop an understanding of the rate at which the CO2 intensity of different countries is changing as the years pass.
